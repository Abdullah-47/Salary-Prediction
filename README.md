## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdullah-47/Salary-Prediction.git
   cd Salary-Prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or, if you are using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
